## Code Optimization Techniques - COT
Experiment with different optimization techniques in Python, such as using list comprehensions vs. traditional loops, optimizing function calls, or leveraging parallel processing with libraries like multiprocessing or concurrent.futures.


### Function calls experiment 

* File name: `function_calls.py`

This experiment is to compare writing code directly in the script and using a method of a class. The main focus is on the execution time between the two methods of writing python code.
